<p>In the tasting room entrance, on display is the Medicine Creek stagecoach. The 
stagecoach is a product of twelve years of work by winemaker Jim Myers.  Prior to building the stagecoach, Jim's hobby 
was restoring horse drawn vehicles.  The stagecoach became his personal challenge to test his woodworking abilities. 
His goal was to produce a vehicle authentic as possible to the 1865 Abbot and Downing 9 passenger western style coach, 
produced by the Concord Coach Company located in Concord Massachusetts. The coach is familiar to most as a "Wells Fargo Stage", but due to trademarks 
this one is aptly named the Medicine Creek Stage 
Line.</p>
<br />
<p>
The Abbot and Downing stagecoach is designed to carry nine passengers, a driver and an armed guard. The coach weighs 2,200 pounds, stands 
ten feet tall and with one drawbar attached is twenty two feet long. The number of animals used to power the coach 
varied from two to eight with four to six being the most common. Additional drawbars were used when adding teams and 
the stagecoach could reach a length of eighty feet.
</p>
<br />
<p>
This type of stagecoach was used to deliver gold, people and freight during the 1860's gold rush era. Stage stops were located 
approximately ten to fifteen miles apart and teams would be changed at each location. The pace of travel averaged 
ten miles an hour. Each stagecoach operated much as a ship at sea in that the driver was the captain and had 
complete authority over all aboard. Passengers could be discharged from the stage at any time for behavioral problems, 
such as discharging a firearm, language offensive to a lady or spitting tobacco juice from the 
window. If a passenger chose to remain off the stagecoach at any point in the trip, they had to wait for someone 
else on a subsequent coach to allow them their seat in order to continue on. Each passenger was allowed thirty five 
pounds of baggage which was carried in the leather compartment at the rear of the coach. A pine strongbox 
was also carried under the driver's seat and was used to transport valuables such as gold bullion.
</p>
<br />
<p>
This stagecoach was displayed at the 2000 Western Washington Fair in Puyuallup and was awareded the Hobby Hall 
grand prize. Jim's stagecoach has survived the 1996 Nisqually river flood and the 2004 6.2 Nisqually earthquake. 
The stagecoach construction was recorded on videotape and Jim created a complete set of plans and templates.
