                <h2>2006 Stage Coach Red</h2>
                <p>A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Merlot this wine expresses the best possible marriage of it's three components. Firm structure balanced with ample fruit delivers a beautifully balanced Bordeaux wine experience! Black cherry, licorice, plum flavors are complimented by notes of cedar, leather,and chocolate. Aging in French Oak barrels over a twenty four month period combined with one year bottle aging prior to release allowed tannins to soften for a silky smooth soft mouthfeel. Stage Coach Red won a Gold Medal at the <a href="http://www.riversidewinecompetition.com">2010 Riverside International Wine Competition</a> as well as winning a Silver Medal at the <a href="http://www.sfwinecomp.com">San Francisco 2010 International Wine Competition</a>. A superior wine well suited for the educated palate.</p>

                <h2>2006 Cabernet Franc</h2>
                <p>This Cabernet Franc represents our best effort to date with this fruit! Our fruit is sourced from a site that has optimum long ripening conditions for Cabernet franc fruit allowing the berries to develop maximum flavor before harvest. This is a delicate, fruitful, complex wine which has a soft mouth feel and retains it's body for a slow smooth finish. Luscious cherry,raspberry currant and cranberry notes give way to darker tones of leather and cedar while experiencing this wine.  It is no accident that this wine won a bronze medal at the prestigious <a href="http://www.sfwinecomp.com">San Francisco 2010 International Wine Competition</a>.</p>

                <h2>2006 Cabernet Sauvignon</h2>
                <p>Dark black cherry fruit with notes of plum, coffee,and leather combine to make up this complex wine.

                <h2>2006 Merlot</h2> 
   				<p>This wine greets you with a soft plum-currant nose.  It keeps its promise expressing a velvety smooth mid-palate flavor with a long fruitful finish. Twenty seven months aging in French Oak barrels combined with sixteen months of bottle aging, create soft-silky tannis and complexity.  This 2006 Merlot is truly an example of Columbia Valley Merlot.<p>

                <h2>2006 Fini</h2>
                <p>A magical wine that was created by a unique set of circumstances during the 2006 harvest. A long, cool, dry, late harvest allowed the Merlot,Malbec, and Cabernet Sauvignon berries to hang on the vines an extra three weeks. During that time the flavors and sugars became extremely concentrated. The resulting dessert wine has an intense fruitful flavor and residual sugar which is perfectly balanced by enough acidity to have a beautiful clean finish. Fini means The End which is our suggestion for how to serve it with a meal. Paired with a warm chocolate brownie, rich vanilla ice cream this wine will amaze your dinner guests with it's raspberry, cherry, spicey notes. A truly special wine for a special occasion. Each bottle is personally hand dipped at our winery and packaged in a presentation bottle. This was a limited edition wine and only 58 cases were made. Fini is only available for sale at the winery tasting room.</p>
